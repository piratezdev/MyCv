# Zaid Hasan Davar — CV Website

This is a simple modern, dark-themed static CV website ready to host on GitHub Pages.

## What's included
- `index.html` — the main page
- `styles.css` — styling (dark aesthetic + print CSS)
- `script.js` — small JS for theme toggle + print
- A link in the site points to `ZAID_HASAN_DAVAR.pdf` for the downloadable resume. Add your PDF with **that filename** to the repo root.

## How to publish on GitHub Pages (quick)
1. Create a new GitHub repository (e.g. `zaid-cv`).
2. Upload all files from this zip to the repository root. Also upload `ZAID_HASAN_DAVAR.pdf` (your resume PDF).
3. In the repository settings → Pages, set the source to the `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder, then Save.
4. GitHub will provide a URL like `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/` — open that to see your CV.

## Tips
- Rename the PDF if you prefer; update the `href` in `index.html` accordingly.
- To host at `https://<your-username>.github.io/` (user site), create a repository named `<your-username>.github.io` and push these files to the `main` branch root.
- Want custom domain? Add `CNAME` file with your domain and configure DNS.

## Printing / PDF
- Use the "Print" button to open the browser print dialog and choose "Save as PDF".
- The site includes print-specific CSS to produce a clean PDF.
